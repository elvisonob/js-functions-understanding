In question 1, we have declared a function called 'myFunction' and it has two parameters 'num1' and 'num2' and the total sum of the parameter is being returned and stored in the result variable.

Result: after the summation, i expect the answer to be 10

In question 2, A function has been declared called 'myFunction' and it has two parameters/arguments called 'num1' and 'num2'. In the block of the function, the two arguments were listed, however, there was no return statement. I am thinking that since there were no return statement, when the function is called in the result variable, it will say 'undefined'

Result: 'undefined'

After running it on my terminal, nothing showed up. Is that anothe response for undefined or null?

Question 3: With the return statement of 'num-1', I think anytime the function is called, the argument will always be subtracted by 1.

Result: 9

When i did 'console.log(num)', I got 8 as the answer and I am not sure why.

When i put 10 as the argument 'console.log(myFunction(10))', i got 9 as the answer.

I am still confused about it especially with the 8 as the answer.

Question 4: With the return statement of 'num-1', I think anytime the function is called, the argument will always be subtracted by 1.

Result: the value of num will still remain 10 because it hasn't been passed to the function as an argument and since the value of add is assigned to 3, it will be deducted twice to 1 because the function was called twice

Question 5: The value logged inside the function call with 'console.log(num1)' will return no value or undefined because nothing was returned inside the function call.

The values 10 and 2 were given outside the function call, hence it can't take effect inside without a return statement.

Result:undefined

Question 6: the function with the argument 'num1' was called at the end of the question, hence after the 'console.log' inside the function was called, it will return 2.

Result:2
Update:I was wrong about this and after talking to the patient, witty, intelligent, nice and understanding tutor, I got a better understanding.

Question 7:'count++' means one number is being added. So, the value of counter will be 3 because counter was originally 1 and then it was called 2 more times.

Result:3

Question 8: Since the function is returning the sum of num1+num2, the answer stored in the result variable will be 14

Result:14

Question 9: If the console is logged out, i think num3 will come out as undefined because it wasn't passed to the argument in the function.

Resule:undefined
Update:I got this part wrong, but i understood when Lewis explained to me.

Question 10: when this code runs, 100 will be logged out of the console because when the function is called, 100 is in same position as 'num3' in the function parameter

Result:100

Question 11:The value of result will be 3 when this code runs because the function is returning the sum of num1, num2 and num3 in the function parameter and hence it has to implement the sum  when the function is called.

Result:3

Question 12: Firstly, whenever function getSomeValue() is called, it will return 2.
It was assigned inside myFunction to num2 and this will automatically make num2 to be 2.
myFunction has a single parameter of num1 and it is to return num1 * num2 and when it was called in result variable the parameter 5 had to multiply 2 and the answer will be 10.

Result:10

Question 13: Firstly, whenever function getSomeValue() is called, it will return 2.
The myFunction has a single parameter of num1.
getSomeValue() was assigned to num2.
The myFunction is to return num1 * getSomeValue().
getSomeValue() will always be 2 when it is called because that is what it is assigned to return earlier.

Hence, when myFunction is called with a single parameter of 5, it is going to multiply getSomeValue() which was initially assigned 2 and the answer will still be 10.

Result:10

Question 14: Once again, The getSomeValue() has been assigned to return 2.
The myFunction has a single parameter of num1 and in the block, it has been assigned to return getSomeValue() * getSomeValue().
I will expect that when it is called, it should return 4. But i am not so sure because the parameter wasn't used.

Result:4

Question 15: I think this myFunction should return -10 when it is called because it said 'if true' and with my little understanding currently, i will say it is true that the function was called in the result variable, hence the first if statement of -10 should be applied.

Result: -10

Question 16: With my understanding of the previous question 15, i think the 'true' supersedes the 'false' and hence the true statement will be returned and this answer will be 50.

Result:50
