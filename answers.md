In question 1, we have declared a function called 'myFunction' and it has two parameters 'num1' and 'num2' and the total sum of the parameter is being returned and stored in the result variable.

Result: after the summation, i expect the answer to be 10

In question 2, A function has been declared called 'myFunction' and it has two parameters/arguments called 'num1' and 'num2'. In the block of the function, the two arguments were listed, however, there was no return statement. I am thinking that since there were no return statement, when the function is called in the result variable, it will say 'undefined'

Result: 'undefined'

After running it on my terminal, nothing showed up. Is that anothe response for undefined or null?

Question 3: With the return statement of 'num-1', I think anytime the function is called, the argument will always be subtracted by 1.

Result: 9

When i did 'console.log(num)', I got 8 as the answer and I am not sure why.

When i put 10 as the argument 'console.log(myFunction(10))', i got 9 as the answer.

I am still confused about it especially with the 8 as the answer.

Question 4: With the return statement of 'num-1', I think anytime the function is called, the argument will always be subtracted by 1.

Result: the value of num will still remain 10 because it hasn't been passed to the function as an argument and since the value of add is assigned to 3, it will be deducted twice to 1 because the function was called twice

Question 5: The value logged inside the function call with 'console.log(num1)' will return no value or undefined because nothing was returned inside the function call.

The values 10 and 2 were given outside the function call, hence it can't take effect inside without a return statement.

Result:undefined

Question 6: the function with the argument 'num1' was called at the end of the question, hence after the 'console.log' inside the function was called, it will return 2.

Result:2
Update:I was wrong about this and after talking to the patient, witty, intelligent, nice and understanding tutor, I got a better understanding.

Question 7:'count++' means one number is being added. So, the value of counter will be 3 because counter was originally 1 and then it was called 2 more times.

Result:3
