In question 1, we have declared a function called 'myFunction' and it has two parameters 'num1' and 'num2' and the total sum of the parameter is being returned and stored in the result variable.

Result: after the summation, i expect the answer to be 10

In question 2, A function has been declared called 'myFunction' and it has two parameters/arguments called 'num1' and 'num2'. In the block of the function, the two arguments were listed, however, there was no return statement. I am thinking that since there were no return statement, when the function is called in the result variable, it will say 'undefined'

Result: 'undefined'

After running it on my terminal, nothing showed up. Is that anothe response for undefined or null?

Question 3: With the return statement of 'num-1', I think anytime the function is called, the argument will always be subtracted by 1.

Result: 9

When i did 'console.log(num)', I got 8 as the answer and I am not sure why.

When i put 10 as the argument 'console.log(myFunction(10))', i got 9 as the answer.

I am still confused about it especially with the 8 as the answer.
